        <h3>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
          if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
          <p class="p3">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
            I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
            Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

          <p class="p3">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.
            I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <h3 class="h33">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
          <p class="p3 p33">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming step by step.
            I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
             In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
             It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

        <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</h3>
          <p class="p3">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
            The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.
            The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
